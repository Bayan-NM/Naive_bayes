# Naive_bayes
Letâ€™s implement a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification. Download the zip archive and run the python program to obtain the classification accuracy on test data. Train and test files contain positively and negatively labelled product reviews. The reviews are preprocessed and expressed as a list of unigrams and bigrams (indicated by underscores) following the bag-of-words model. Each review is represented as a single line in the file and features (unigrams and bigrams) extracted from that review are listed space delimited. Modify the Naive Bayes code and see what happens if we do not use Laplace smoothing.
